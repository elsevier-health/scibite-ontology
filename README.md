# A public repository for HGNC

This repository has been established to provide a public version of hgnc.owl to HGNC to distribute to their users via their website:
https://www.genenames.org/download/statistics-and-files/

This HGNC OWL file is generated from the data at https://www.genenames.org/. It contains all genes in HGNC organised in a shallow hierarchy, classified by their locus type and gene group. Gene groups are also derived from HGNC. The ontology contains approved gene symbol, approved gene name, previous names and symbols and mappings to external databases.

The file is regenerated approximately every 2 months, and will be deposited here.
